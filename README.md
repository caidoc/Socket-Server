# Poem Client-Server
## Overview
The Poem Client-Server project is a simple Java application that demonstrates client-server communication using sockets. The server responds to client requests by providing lines from a poem stored in a text file. The client can send requests(number) to the server to retrieve specific lines or nthline from the poem.
